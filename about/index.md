My name is Darryn Brownfield and currently working as a network engineer in the UK. 

## My reason for this blog?

When I started my journey in to learning Infosec I used and relied on (still do) various blogs and resources which have helped with CTF's and also passing OSCP. This blog is my way of giving back to the fantastic community and hoping it helps others in their journey.
